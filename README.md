# UMSL-4280-Programing-Translation
UMSL Compiler Course Projects
# Course Description
Prerequisites: CMPSCI2700, CMPSCI 2750, CMP SCI 3130, and CMP SCI 4250, or graduate standing. This course focuses on methods, techniques, and mechanisms used to bridge the abstraction from high level programming to machine level execution. This course also focuses on developing a complex individual project incrementally in separate modules, tested and integrated.

#Course Objectives and Learning Outcome
The course will have a semester long project to build a working compiler, translating from some subset of a modern programming language into a simple assembly or machine language with available virtual machine for execution. One of the main objectives is to build a working product from independently tested modules.Topics and objectives not related to translation
Programming standards
Program architecture and modularization, internal vs. external linkage, header files
Building a larger project from components
Problem decomposition
Incremental development, testing, integration
Topics and objectives related to languages and translation
Generation vs. interpretation
BNF notation, standard and extended
Ambiguity, precedence and associativity
Top-down vs. bottom-up compilers
Modular and reconfigurable compilers, front end vs. back endInterpretive compilers (Java or Pascal)
Cross vs. host translationBootstrapping
Improving compiler and target properties
Static semantics vs. execution semantics
Global vs. local storage allocationProcess space elementsTombstone (T, mushroom) notation
The need for program translation, constraints, tradeoffsChomsky hierarchy of languages
Algorithms and properties for regular and context free languages
Upon completion, a student should be able to
Develop complex software using proper programming and architectural standards
Develop complex software incrementally, independently tested and integrated
Assist with translation needs
